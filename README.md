# ARQ transmission in Ethernet

## Project goal:

The objective of our project was to implement automatic repeat request (ARQ) transmission in an Ethernet network and conduct an analysis of its effectiveness based on several key factors. The research included assessing the impact of the following variables:

- Noise coefficient
- Message length
- Number of devices
